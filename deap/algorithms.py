"""The :mod:`algorithms` module is intended to contain some specific algorithms
in order to execute very common evolutionary algorithms. The method used here
are more for convenience than reference as the implementation of every 
evolutionary algorithm may vary infinitely. Most of the algorithms in this 
module use operators registered in the toolbox. Generaly, the keyword used are
:meth:`mate` for crossover, :meth:`mutate` for mutation, :meth:`~deap.select`
for selection and :meth:`evaluate` for evaluation.

You are encouraged to write your own algorithms in order to make them do what
you really want them to do.

    The variator goes as follow. First, the parental population
    :math:`P_\mathrm{p}` is duplicated using the :meth:`toolbox.clone` method
    and the result is put into the offspring population :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`.
    A first loop over :math:`P_\mathrm{o}` is executed to mate consecutive
    individuals. According to the crossover probability *cxpb*, the
    individuals :math:`\mathbf{x}_i` and :math:`\mathbf{x}_{i+1}` are mated
    using the :meth:`toolbox.mate` method. The resulting children
    :math:`\mathbf{y}_i` and :math:`\mathbf{y}_{i+1}` replace their respective
    parents in :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`. A second loop over the resulting
    :math:`P_\mathrm{o}` is executed to mutate every individual with a
    probability *mutpb*. When an individual is mutated it replaces its not
    mutated version in :math:`P_\mathrm{o}`. The resulting
    :math:`P_\mathrm{o}` is returned.
    
    This variation is named *And* beceause of its propention to apply both
    crossover and mutation on the individuals. Note that both operators are
    not applied systematicaly, the resulting individuals can be generated from
    crossover only, mutation only, crossover and mutation, and reproduction
    according to the given probabilities. Both probabilities should be in

    It uses :math:`\lambda = \kappa = \mu` and goes as follow.
    It first initializes the population (:math:`P(0)`) by evaluating
    every individual presenting an invalid fitness. Then, it enters the
    evolution loop that begins by the selection of the :math:`P(g+1)`
    population. Then the crossover operator is applied on a proportion of
    :math:`P(g+1)` according to the *cxpb* probability, the resulting and the
    untouched individuals are placed in :math:`P'(g+1)`. Thereafter, a
    proportion of :math:`P'(g+1)`, determined by *mutpb*, is 
    mutated and placed in :math:`P''(g+1)`, the untouched individuals are
    transferred :math:`P''(g+1)`. Finally, those new individuals are evaluated
    and the evolution loop continues until *ngen* generations are completed.
    Briefly, the operators are applied in the following order ::
